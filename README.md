# DriveDirect in Python (command line)
## Get a Direct Download Link to a Google Drive file through Python

#### Get the GUI version [here](https://github.com/ThisIsNoahEvans/DriveDirect-GUI)

## How It Works
Once launched, the program requests a Google Drive sharing link. This can be found through the Link Sharing feature of Google Drive. It doesn't work with Google Docs files - only actual files with a visible file extension in Google Drive. (for example: .png files, .pdf documents, or .mp4 videos)

The program then adjusts the URL to the direct download format - like when you click the Download button in Google Drive - and will print that URL to the screen. It'll also copy the URL to your clipboard, replacing what was there before (which was probably the original non-direct URL).

This is particularly useful for direct download links on websites.

## Enjoy!
