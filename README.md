Get a Direct Download Link to a Google Drive file through Python

### Download the latest version [here](https://github.com/ThisIsNoahEvans/DriveDirect-CMD/releases/download/v1.2/DriveDirect-CMD_1.2.py)
#### Get the GUI version [here](https://github.com/ThisIsNoahEvans/DriveDirect-GUI)

## How It Works
Once launched, the program requests a Google Drive sharing link. This can be found through the Link Sharing feature of Google Drive. It doesn't work with Google Docs files - only actual files with a visible file extension in Google Drive. (for example: .png files, .pdf documents, or .mp4 videos)

The program then adjusts the URL to the direct download format - like when you click the Download button in Google Drive - and will print that URL to the screen. It'll also copy the URL to your clipboard, replacing what was there before (which was probably the original non-direct URL).

## Enjoy!
